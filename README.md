# Ticket_System

A help desk ticket system built with vanilla html, css, javascript, php, and rust.


### The Purpose

The reason I am doing this project was to tackle a full stack project and complete it. This of course will be available to anyone who needs this type of system but for me it is mainly practice for my front end skills, back end skills, and systems programming as well as diagrams. 

### The Tech

At the moment what I am using to build this system is the standard HTML, CSS, Javascript for the front end, PHP and mariadb for the backend as well as Rust for building the multi threaded server for this to run.

### Platforms

I plan on eventually doing plenty of different platform releases with the first ones to be tested being Ubuntu / Debian and creating a docker image. Windows, Mac, and other linux images will be hopefully built but who knows when completed and working.

### Final Note

This project may take a long time but it is here for my learning experience to try things and to have a completed project one day so please stick around and view other repositories in the future.
