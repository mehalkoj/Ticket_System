# Ticket_System

A help desk ticket system built with vanilla html, css, javascript, php, and rust.


### The Purpose

The reason I am doing this project was to tackle a full stack project and complete it. This of course will be available to anyone who needs this type of system but for me it is mainly practice for my front end skills, back end skills, and systems programming as well as diagrams. This will also be implementing other projects into this one that you can see on my github for instance a document editor in browser would be useful with this system as well. So I encourage to look at the other projects to see what interests you. This README file for the project is going to be very detailed and explain a lot of decisions which some might not be the best practice or will be changed over time, this is all part of the learning experience.

### The Tech

The tech at the moment unless I change my mind is going to be vanilla html, css, javascript, PHP, mariadb, and rust. Now at the moment I will be using the fetch API with javascript to grab the data from PHP but that might change to AJAX or some other tool. I might redo the front end later down the line into a framework like Vue but this is my goal for right now and what I am actively working towards. Javascript is obviously a huge part of this project with many portions of the pages being built in javascript functions that are creating HTML DOM elements dynamically for the pages.

Besides the regular front end and back end tech to make this app functional I will have a mariadb database and work in progress multi threaded server coded from Rust. This server is still a heavy work in progress and is a little bit on the back burner but I got the idea from the Rust book which actually has a project at the end of it that is building a single threaded server then a multi threaded. I chose Rust over Java, C++ or just running it on Apache is because I really wanted this experience in coding an infrastructure. From my understanding of Rust compared to C++ is the fact that it is actually quite safer in the Memory Leaks and weird behavior department. Obviosuly I dont get the immense amount of features and things that C++ has but Rust has been an interesting dive.

### Platforms

I plan on eventually doing plenty of different platform releases with the first ones to be tested being Ubuntu / Debian and creating a docker image. Windows, Mac, and other linux images will be hopefully built but who knows when completed and working.

### Final Note

This project may take a long time but it is here for my learning experience to try things and to have a completed project one day so please stick around and view other repositories in the future.
